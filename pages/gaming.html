                My Hobby: Gaming<br>
                Gaming has always been one of my biggest passions. I love exploring virtual worlds, building, managing, and surviving in games that combine creativity with strategy. Some of my all-time favorites include ARK: Survival Ascended, Transport Fever 2, and Cities: Skylines — games that let me create, plan, and experiment in different ways.
                <br>In ARK, I enjoy taming creatures, building bases, and slowly shaping my own world. In Transport Fever 2 and Cities: Skylines, I can relax while designing efficient transport networks and thriving cities — it’s both challenging and calming at the same time.
                <br>Someday, I’d like to create my own game, inspired by the types of experiences I enjoy playing. Learning Python and Pygame is my first step toward that goal, and I’m excited to see how my skills and ideas evolve along the way.
