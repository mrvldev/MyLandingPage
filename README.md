"The Odin Project" - Project #2 #make a landing page

This is the second Project of "The Odin Project".
The assignement to do this is listed at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

I will try to make a landing page for my own,
to represent my future projects on the web.
It will be with black background and some funny KI pics.
For the Pics i use LeonardoAI, wich is for me a great solution for testing with high quality images.
I will write first the html and the i will add an css stylesheet.

I hope you will enjoy my project.
